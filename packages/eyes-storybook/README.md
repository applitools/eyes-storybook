# Eyes-Storybook

Applitools Eyes SDK for [Storybook](http://storybook.js.org).

## Installation

### Install npm package

Install Eyes-Storybook as a local dev dependency in your tested project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @applitools/eyes-storybook
```

### Applitools API key

In order to authenticate via the Applitools server, you need to supply the Eyes-Storybook SDK with the API key you got from Applitools. Read more about how to obtain the API key [here](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/overview/obtain-api-key.html).

To to this, set the environment variable `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` to the API key before running your tests.
For example, on Linux/Mac:

```bash
export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your_key>
```

And on Windows:

```bash
set APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your_key>
```

## Usage

After completing the installation and defining the API key, you will be able to run Eyes-Storybook from the command line and let it take screenshots of all your stories.

If your project is using the default storybook config folder (i.e. `<project_folder>/.storybook`), then run the following command:

```bash
npx eyes-storybook
```

### Configuring local storybook server

Normally, Eyes-Storybook starts a storybook dev server in an available port between 9000-9010 for the duration of the tests. It's possible to pass arguments to Eyes-Storybook to configure the local storybook server:

- `--storybook-port OR -p`: Port to run storybook (passed as `-p` to `start-storybook`).
- `--storybook-host OR -h`: Host to run storybook (passed as `-h` to `start-storybook`).
- `--storybook-config-dir OR -c`: Directory where to load Storybook configurations from (passed as `-c` to `start-storybook`)
- `--storybook-static-dir OR -s`: Directory where to load static files from, comma-separated list (passed as `-s` to `start-storybook`)

### Standalone server

As noted in the previous section, Eyes-Storybook starts a storybook dev server. If you wish to start the server outside of Eyes-Storybook, or test a production build that's available at a certain URL, then just specify the URL for the storybook in the command line (or in the configuration file, see [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) below).

For example:

```bash
npx eyes-storybook -u http://localhost:6006
```

Or for a production storybook:

```bash
npx eyes-storybook -u http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/
```

### Command line arguments

The full list of command line arguments can be viewed by running `npx eyes-storybook --help`:

```

## Concurrency

The default level of concurrency for free accounts is `10`. This means that only up to 10 visual tests can run in parallel, and therefore the execution might be slow.
If your account does support a higher level of concurrency, it's possible to pass a different value by specifying it in the property `concurrency` in the applitools.config.js file (see [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) section below).

If you are interested in speeding up your visual tests, contact sdr@applitools.com to get a trial account and faster tests with more concurrency.

| `readStoriesTimeout`      | 60000                       | The amount of time (in milliseconds) Eyes-Storybook waits for storybook to load. For old storybook versions 2 and 3, this is also the time it takes for Eyes-Storybook to acknowledge it is working on those versions. So it is recommended to make this value small (e.g. 3000) when working with Storybook version 2 or 3. |

<!-- | `accessibilityLevel`      | None                        | The accessibility level to use for the screenshots. Possible values are `None`, `AA` and `AAA`. | -->
There are 2 ways to specify test configuration:

1) Environment variables
2) The `applitools.config.js` file

The list above is also the order of precedence, which means that if you specify a property as an environment variable, it will override the value defined for the same property in the `applitools.config.js` file.

### Method 1: Environment variables

The name of the corresponding environment variable is in uppercase, with the `APPLITOOLS_` prefix, and separating underscores instead of camel case:

```js
APPLITOOLS_APP_NAME
APPLITOOLS_SHOW_LOGS
APPLITOOLS_BATCH_ID
APPLITOOLS_BATCH_NAME
APPLITOOLS_BATCH_SEQUENCE_NAME
APPLITOOLS_PROXY
APPLITOOLS_NOTIFY_ON_COMPLETION
...
// all other configuration variables apply as well..
```
<!-- APPLITOOLS_ACCESSIBILITY_LEVEL -->

### Method 2: The `applitools.config.js` file

It's possible to have a file called `applitools.config.js` at the current working directory (the directory you are at when running the `eyes-storybook` script). In this file specify the desired configuration, as an exported CommonJS module. For example:

```js
module.exports = {
  appName: 'My app',
  showLogs: true,
  batchName: 'My batch'
  ...
  // all other configuration variables apply
}
```

## Configuring the browser

Eyes-Storybook will take a screenshot of the page as specified in the `browser` configuration parameter.

Possible values are:

- `chrome`
- `firefox`
- `edge`
- `ie10`
- `ie11`
- `safari`
- `chrome-one-version-back`
- `chrome-two-versions-back`
- `firefox-one-version-back`
- `firefox-two-versions-back`
- `safari-one-version-back`
- `safari-two-versions-back`

### Previous browser versions

`*-one-version-back` and `*-two-versions-back` are relative to the version of the same browser. For example, if `chrome` refers to version 79, then `chrome-one-version-back` will be Chrome 78 and `chrome-two-versions-back` will be Chrome 77.

### Getting a screenshot of multiple browsers in parallel

It's also possible to send an array of browsers, for example in the `applitools.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: [
    {width: 800, height: 600, name: 'firefox'},
    {width: 1024, height: 768, name: 'chrome'},
    {width: 1024, height: 768, name: 'ie11'}
  ]
}
```

### Device emulation

To enable chrome's device emulation, it's possible to send a device name and screen orientation, for example:

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: {
    deviceName: 'iPhone X',
    screenOrientation: 'landscape',
    name: 'chrome' // optional, just to make it explicit this is browser emulation and not a real device. Only chrome is supported for device emulation.
  }
}
```

Possible values for screen orientation are `landscape` and `portrait`, and if no value is specified, the default is `portrait`.

The list of device names is taken from [chrome devtools predefined devices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chromium/chromium/0aee4434a4dba42a42abaea9bfbc0cd196a63bc1/third_party/blink/renderer/devtools/front_end/emulated_devices/module.json), and can be obtained by running the following command in a unix-based shell (installing [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) might be needed):

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chromium/chromium/0aee4434a4dba42a42abaea9bfbc0cd196a63bc1/third_party/blink/renderer/devtools/front_end/emulated_devices/module.json | jq '.extensions[].device.title'
```

In addition, it's possible to use chrome's device emulation with custom viewport sizes, pixel density and mobile mode, by passing `deviceScaleFactor` and `mobile` in addition to `width` and `height`. For example:

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: {
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    deviceScaleFactor: 3,
    mobile: true,
    name: 'chrome' // optional, just to make it explicit this is browser emulation and not a real device. Only chrome is supported for device emulation.
  }
}
```

## Per component configuration

### _Only supported in Storybook version >= 4_

There are two ways to provide configuration for a specific story, or a group of stories.

1. **As an argument to the story** - It's possible to pass a third argument to storybook's `.add` function to customize each story. An `eyes` property on the parameters object can be specified with configuration properties.

2. **In the global configuration file, `applitools.config.js`** - If a function is specified for one of the properties below, it will be called for each story, and will be passed the story's metadata, of the structure `{name, kind, parameters}`, where `name` is the name of the component, `kind` is the string built by storybook for the category, e.g. `Forms|Input/Text`, and `parameters` are the third argument to storybook's `.add` function. The function should return the configuration value for the specific property+story.

_Specifying a value locally in the story takes precedence over the global config value._

#### The following properties are supported:

### `include`

When `false`, the component will not be visually tested. For example:

```js
// This story will not be tested visually
storiesOf('Some kind', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () => <div>I am visually perfect!</div>,
    {eyes: {include: false}}
  )
```

### `variations`

An array of string values, which specifies which variations to add for this story. For each value, an additional visual test will be executed for the component. It will have the same name only with a `[<variation name>]` suffix, and when the component is loaded, the URL will have an additional param: `eyes-variation=<variation name>`.

This can accommodate many use cases, for example RTL (right to left).
It's now possible for the component to render its variation version when the relevant URL param is present. For Example, here's a storybook that handles an RTL variation:

```js
const isRTL = new URL(window.location).searchParams.get('eyes-variation') === 'RTL';

if (isRTL) {
  document.documentElement.setAttribute('dir', 'rtl')
}

// 2 visual tests will be created - one for LTR and one for RTL
storiesOf('Components that support RTL', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () => <div>
        <span>I am visually perfect!</span>
        <span>{isRTL ? ' and rendered right to left as well :)' : ''}</span>
      </div>,
    {eyes: {variations: ['RTL']}}
  )
```

### `waitBeforeScreenshot`

Selector or timeout, see [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) for more details.

```js
storiesOf('Components with a waitBeforeScreenshot', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () => <span id="container" class="loading"></span>,
    {eyes: { waitBeforeScreenshot: '#container.ready' }}
  );
```

_Note that the predicate option for `waitBeforeScreenshot` is currently not available in the per component configuration._

### _The following parameters cannot be set as an [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) :_

<!-- ### `accessibility`

A single or an array of regions for accessibility checking. For example:

```js
storiesOf('Components with accessibility regions', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () => <div>
      <span>I am visually perfect!<span>
      <span className="check-me">this should be tested for accessibility</span>
    {eyes: {
      accessibility: [
        {accessibilityType: 'RegularText', selector: '.check-me'},
      ]
    }}
  )
});
```

Possible accessibilityType values are: `IgnoreContrast`,`RegularText`,`LargeText`,`BoldText` and `GraphicalObject`. -->

### `ignore`

A single or an array of regions to ignore when checking for visual differences. For example:

```js
storiesOf('Components with ignored region', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () =>
      <div>
        <span>I am visually perfect!</span>
        <span className="ignore-this">this should be ignored</span>
      </div>,
    {eyes: { ignore: [{selector: '.ignore-this'}] }}
  )
```

### `runBefore`

An asynchronous function that will be evaluated before the story's screenshot is taken. This is the place to perform any interaction with the story using DOM API's.

For performing various DOM interactions, we recommend checking out [dom-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library). It provides utilities to interact, query and wait for conditions on the DOM.

For example, a component that renders a popover could trigger the opening of the popover and wait for content to appear:

```js
// these are utilities from dom-testing-library
import {wait, within, fireEvent} from '@testing-library/dom';

// <Popover /> is a component in your UI library.
// The assumption in this example is that it is opened by an element with the text 'Open',
// and then that element's text changes to 'Close':
storiesOf('UI components', module)
  .add('Popover', () => <Popover />, {
    eyes: {
      runBefore({rootEl, story}) {
        fireEvent.click(within(rootEl).getByText('Open'))
        return wait(() => within(rootEl).getByText('Close'))
      }
    },
  })

## Running Eyes-Storybook in Docker

When running the SDK in docker, there might be issues related to properly launching the internal chrome browser via puppeteer. If you seem to have such issues, set `runInDocker: true` in your config file. This will pass the internal chrome browser special arguments, as described [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#tips).

If you still have issues, you might need to follow the instructions to use your own chromium browser in the docker container, and point that to the SDK's puppeteer. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#running-puppeteer-in-docker) and set the `executablePath` via the `puppeteerOptions`. For example, `applitools.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  puppeteerOptions: {
    executablePath: '/usr/bin/chromium-browser'
  }
}
```

## Dealing with dynamic data

Sometimes components render dynamic data, such as dates, or random data. This creates a challenge when testing these components. The way we recommend to address this issue is to insert code into your storybook which normalizes the data (uses fixed dates, or a specific seed), when it is being run in an automated environment.

Eyes storybook makes it possible for components to be aware that they are being tested. There will be a specific query parameter on the URL of the story's iframe: `?eyes-storybook=true`.

This way it's possible to write a story like this:

```js
const isBeingTested =
    new URL(window.location).searchParams.get('eyes-storybook')

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur, the `saveDebugData` config property can be set to true in order to save helpful information. The information will be saved under a folder named `.applitools` in the current working directory. This could be then used for getting support on your issue.
<br/>You can also use [DEBUG=eyes*](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) for debugging.
